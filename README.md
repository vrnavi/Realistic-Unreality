This modpack is shipped WITHOUT the Earth world. In order to play this modpack in Singleplayer, you will have to generate one yourself.

**Here's a quick guide to create a world for this modpack.**
1. Visit [this website](https://earth.motfe.net/), and click on Downloads.
2. Scroll ALL the way to the bottom.
3. Download `earth_1-1000_1-12.world` from the WorldPainter files.
4. Download WorldPainter from [here](https://www.worldpainter.net/).
5. Open the `earth_1-1000_1-12.world` file in WorldPainter, and export it with the following settings: 
- Set the name to **DIM24**.
- Under Custom Layers, disable all of the the End Portals.
6. Before creating a new world, open the saves folder in your MultiMC Minecraft instance.
7. Create a new folder, name it whatever you want, and place the DIM24 world inside.
8. Launch the modpack, and create a new world with the same name as the folder you created earlier.
9. Your world is ready to play on.
